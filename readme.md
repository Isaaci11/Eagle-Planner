# EaglePlanner

## Overview
EaglePlanner is a to-do list style planner built for students at EPHS. It connects to the Schoology API and loads your assignments automatically. It also includes basic features of a to-do list such as adding custom assignments and editing the assignment aspects.

## HTML, CSS, and JS
We used HTML, CSS, and JS for the base of our website. The styles and basic functionality is executed here.

## Python
Python is used as our backend. It does the calculations for dates and communicates with the Schoology API. We use AJAX to fetch data from the Python which is hosted by the server, and then the JavaScript distributes the data.
